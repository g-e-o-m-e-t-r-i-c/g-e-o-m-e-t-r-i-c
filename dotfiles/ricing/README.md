# g-e-o-m-e-t-r-i-c/g-e-o-m-e-t-r-i-c/dotfiles/ricing

A collection of my dotfiles, specifically for ricing my desktop.

## In This Directory

You'll find:
- My Neovim configuration
- My [`kitty`](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) configuration, as well as my [Starship Prompt](https://starship.rs/) configuration.
- My [`neofetch`](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) configuration
- My [`i3`](https://i3wm.org/) configuration, along with my [`rofi`](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) configuration.

## Notes

### Desktop Environment
- I use a colorscheme generated by [`pywal`](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal), so the only colorscheme configurations I have are to make the applications use the colorscheme.

- The wallpapers I use are found on [imgur](https://imgur.com), and some of these images might have licenses. If you see your work in this directory, please inform me and I will gladly take it down.

- I don't use `polybar`, `lemonbar` or any status bars for my window manager as I find them quite distracting.

### Terminal Environment
- The [Starship Prompt](https://starship.rs/) requires the use of [Nerd Fonts](https://nerdfonts.com) and a terminal which has Unicode support, like `kitty`.

### Software I Use

- I use [`zathura`](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/), and have set its colorscheme to the one generated by [`pywal`](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) using [this script](https://github.com/GideonWolfe/Zathura-Pywal)

- Like the [Starship Prompt](https://starship.rs), my Neovim configuration requires Nerd Fonts for [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) and the [icons](https://github.com/ryanoasis/vim-devicons/).
