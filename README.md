Hi, I'm [@g-e-o-m-e-t-r-i-c](https://github.com/g-e-o-m-e-t-r-i-c/g-e-o-m-e-t-r-i-c)! I'm a member of my school's Infocomm Club.

**Things I'm currently learning:**

-   🐧 Ubuntu 20.04 Bash Commands
-   🌳 Git Branches

**Also interested in:**

-   🧮 Mathematics (I especially like Algebra)
-   🎹 Piano

**Stuff I did:**

-   🌐 A [random website](https://github.com/g-e-o-m-e-t-r-i-c/final-web-project) for school
-   🐍 A Python `arcade` [Shooter Game](https://github.com/g-e-o-m-e-t-r-i-c/shooter-game)
-   👩‍💻 A collection of [ciphers](https://github.com/g-e-o-m-e-t-r-i-c/ciphers), with some friends

**In this repository:**
Files in the `dotfiles-wsl` directory are (duh) my dotfiles for WSL Ubuntu-20.04.

They include:

-   My `~/.vimrc` (see image below)
-   My `starship.toml`: Config file for my [Starship Prompt](https://starship.rs/).
